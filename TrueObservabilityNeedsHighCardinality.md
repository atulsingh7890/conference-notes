- Nice analogy on driving in Fog with low visibility wiht lot of Fog.
- Its generally recommended to slow down. But while we are moving slow we dont know whats ahead of us. 
- While if you think of an Aeroplane, they dont have to move slow in Fog they have lots of instruments in Place to avoid any visibility issues.
- Taking parallel from this, We have Agile Systems, CI CD systems which helps us in moving faster without even knowing where exactly where we are headed.
- This is observability as per presenter - Moving Faster and building things to move faster. 
- **Reaching Production is only the beginning.**
- **No system is immune to failure: Be ready to recover**
- **When Distributing the System | We are also distributing the Places | where things might go wrong**
- **Monitoring Only applies to known failure modes , What about everything else ?**
  - Monitoring and Obesrvability is not the same thing.
  - Because Monitoring is about the things you know.
